 Teeny lil template chat modular thingy
 no imports or actual code, just a nice template to work from.

# design thingys :
* Red and Black theme interface.
* black background with red moving particles populated with a dynamic three.js background. 
* Beneath is a left panel container.
* Two centre containers perfectly sized with no overlap.
* A lower container panel at the bottom rectangular chat style.  
* a navbar with three buttons.

# Note #
I tried the make the code as small and light and singular as possible without any imports so it can be easily modified.

If you want to use this locally offline with ollama or easy diffusion or other offline stuff.
